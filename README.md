University Student Manager

Overview

University Student Manager is a desktop application developed in C# (Windows Forms) that allows users to manage university students’ data easily and efficiently.
The project focuses on practical use of ListView, event handling, and dynamic UI updates.

This application simulates a simple student management system used by a university administration officer to register, view, edit, and delete student records.

	4- Edit Student Information:Modify any student’s details through a separate edit form.
	5- Delete Student:Delete an existing student with a confirmation message to prevent accidental deletions.
