University Student Manager

Overview

University Student Manager is a desktop application developed in C# (Windows Forms) that allows users to manage university students’ data easily and efficiently.
The project focuses on practical use of ListView, event handling, and dynamic UI updates.

This application simulates a simple student management system used by a university administration officer to register, view, edit, and delete student records.

Features
	•	Add New Student:
Add a new student with ID, name, college, major, and academic level.
	•	Dynamic College-Major Relation:
Majors are dynamically loaded based on the selected college. Each college has its specific set of majors.
	•	Conditional Academic Level:
If the selected college is Engineering, “Preparatory Engineering” level appears; otherwise, standard levels are shown.
	•	Edit Student Information:
Modify any student’s details through a separate edit form.
	•	Delete Student:
Delete an existing student with a confirmation message to prevent accidental deletions.
	•	Fill Random Data:
Automatically fill the ListView with 10 random student records (college, major, and level are randomly selected).
	•	Flexible ListView Modes:
Display students in various styles such as Details, Large Icon, Small Icon, or Tile view — just like Windows Explorer.
